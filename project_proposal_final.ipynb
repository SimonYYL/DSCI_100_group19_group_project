    "We expect that if our created tennis player has superior stats to their opponent, they will be victorious. Conversely, if our player has inferior stats to the opponent, they will lose the match. These findings could be useful in predicting the outcomes of future or hypothetical tennis matches, given the competing players' past match histories. It could also be helpful in isolating certain stats that most strongly dictate the chances of victory, thus providing a better way of judging a player's skill.\n",
