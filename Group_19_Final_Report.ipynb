    "### Background \n",
    "\n",
    "Tennis is a popular, competitive sport played around the world. In tennis, players gain points by hitting a tennis ball, across a net in the court, in such a way that their opponent is unable to hit it back without the ball bouncing twice. \n",
    "Tennis can be played in \"singles\" where there is only one person on each side of the net or \"doubles\" where there are teams of two. \n",
    "It can be played on a variety of surfaces such as grass, clay, or hard court (i.e. like a gym floor).\n",
    "\n",
    "The association of tennis professionals, or ATP, organizes these tournaments and collects data on the players and the matches that take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the career statistics of a tennis player, what will be their win rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the \"Game results for Top 500 Players from 2017-2019\" dataset for our analysis. Each row in this dataset represents a match between two players. Each row contains player stats (e.g. age, height, rank) and match stats (break points, serve points, double faults etc.). We can use this data to determine the relationship between player stats and win rate.\n",
