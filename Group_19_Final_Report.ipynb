Each row contains player stats (e.g. age, height, rank) and match stats (break points, serve points, double faults etc.). We can use this data to determine the relationship between a player's stats and their win rate for this time period.\n",

To answer our predictive question, we will train both KNN and linear regression models and then compare to find the model type and predictors that give the lowest error. Once we we have the best model, we will try to predict the win rate for a new player observation."

Using these variables, we trained a KNN regression model that had RMSPE of only 8.53. This RMSPE is lower compared to a linear regression model using the same predictors.\n",

    "This result makes sense because a player that has lots of rank points and a strong serve is likely to win more games. The RMSPE differences between the KNN model and linear regression models was also expected because we observed a non-linear relationship between rank points and win rate.  We used our model to predict the win rate for a player with 1400 rank points and a first serve win % of 46%. The outcome was approximately what we would expect for such an above average player based on the mean stats we calculated above.\n",

    "The KNN regression model will need to be trained, evaluated, and tuned with training and testing sets before predicting a win rate on a new player. By organizing a data set to keep track of both the K and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) values calculated, we will be able to visualize how each predictor affects the player's win rate. We can then further analyze which combination of predicators, if any, will yield the lowest test error resulting in a better ability to predict a player's win rate."

Additionally, as the win rate is based on existing stats, it can be used to provide a clearer estimate of the result of a head-to-head match. \n",
