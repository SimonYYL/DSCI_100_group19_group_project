    "Overall, we found that a player's \"mean rank points\" and \"first serve win %\" are good predictors for estimating a player's win rate. Using these variables, we trained a KNN regression model that had RMSPE of only 8.53. This RMSPE is lower compared to a linear regression model using the same predictors. We tested our model on a newly created player with 1400 rank points and a first serve win % of 46%, and the predicted win rate was 52%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result makes sense because a player that has lots of rank points and a strong serve is likely to win more games. The RMSPE differences between the KNN model and linear regression models was also expected because we observed a non-linear relationship between rank points and win rate. In our test player, the outcome was approximately what we would expect. Since the predictors were slightly above  based on the mean stats we calculated above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model can predict the win rate of a tennis player using only a few statistics, and this could be useful in several ways. For one, it gives a sense of how the player will perform in the future. In other words, with the knowledge of their win rate, one can make a rough estimate of a player's chances in an upcoming match, tournament or season. This could be useful in a range of practical applications including scouting, sports betting, or even simply personal knowledge.\n",
    "\n",

    "Some further questions that this analysis raised include: \n",
    "\n",
    " - Are the other stats within the dataset able to be predicted by win rate and first serve win percentage (i.e. going off those two stats, can we be confident all the other stats are \"good\")?\n",
    " - Are there stats not included in the dataset that could improve the effectiveness of the model?\n",
    " - Do certain stats influence win rate more, and if so, is there a better weight function to use in the regression engine?\n",
